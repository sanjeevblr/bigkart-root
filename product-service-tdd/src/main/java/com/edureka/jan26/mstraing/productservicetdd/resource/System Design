Vague Question - (Can you) Design Netflix?


A) Come up with the requirement after probing interviewer?

    Functional Requirements

    - User "should be" able to upload video( Publisher/ End Users)
    - User "should be" able to view and share the video.
    - User "should be" able to recommend.
    - User "should be" able to rate, like/dislike etc.
    - User "should be" able to view the number of "views" of the video.
    - User "should be" able to view the sorted (custom based on recent/popularity etc.) in the home page.

    Non-functional Requirements

    - System should be able to scale upto 1M concurrent user.
    - System should be reliable with 99999 availablity.
    - User/System should be able to give near realtime experice/performance.
    - System should be able to absorb small faults.

    The system design is going to be one or few functional requirements.

B) Do the capacity planning
    Number of users concurrent/ total
    Number of videos per minute/hour/days/month/year
    Bandwidth calculation
    Rate of growth the data.



    In Youtube
        Total number of users = 1.5 Billion ( .2 Billon)
        Active Use 20 % of total users = 300 M

        View
           300M * 5 minute video / 24 * 60 * 60 ~ 500 videos / sec

        Storage estimation

           100M * 5 MB = 100TB

C) Talk about multi DC.
    - Functional Partitioning which means that all video from India will be stored in Mumbai DC.
    - Geo Routing
    - ...

D) System API

    uploadVideo(API Key, UserId, Video Title, Video Content, Region, Country)

F) System Design
    Very verbose and use diagram as much as you can.

G) Domain Modeling
    Id
    User
    Title
    Byte array video content
    ..
    ..
H) Layered Architecture
    Repository
    Service
    Resources..




5000 request per minutes

each container will get 1000 request per minutes

each containe will 15 request per second.
